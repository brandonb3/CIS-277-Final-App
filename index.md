# CIS 277 Final App
## My final app is called Calculator +
 
This app is a scientific calculator and is created for students and teachers. This is a scientific calculator therefore it can do anything a basic calculator can do and more. Do you need to add something, multiply, or divide? It will do it for you. Or do you need to find the square root of a number? It will figure that out for you as well. This calculator can do multiple functions, find the tangent of a value of degrees and the log of a number. It also has a built in equation list that you can reference to, to help you find area, volume, or just common equations you'd come across in math. 

This app will ask you to input the number for the operation or function you want to perform and then ask you to input your value and then it will output your answer.
